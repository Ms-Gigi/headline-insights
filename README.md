# Headline Analyzer Program

## Overview
The Headline Analyzer Program is a Python tool designed to analyze text data, specifically headlines. It provides various functionalities such as counting specific words, calculating average headline length, finding the longest and shortest headlines, analyzing word frequency, filtering headlines by length, and exporting results. This program is ideal for journalists, data analysts, or anyone working with headline datasets.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
1. File Handling:
- Read and write files.
- Handle file not found and empty file errors gracefully.

2. Python Data Structures:
- Work with lists, strings, and dictionaries.
- Use list comprehensions for filtering and processing text.

3. Text Processing:
- Case-insensitive word matching.
- Tokenization and word frequency analysis using collections.Counter.

4. Mathematical Computations:
- Calculate averages (e.g., average headline length).
- Find maximum and minimum values (e.g., longest and shortest headlines).

5. Data Visualization:
- Create bar charts to visualize word frequency using matplotlib.

6. User Interaction:
- Implement a menu-driven interface for user input and program flow control.
- Validate user input for robust error handling.

7. Modular Design:
- Write reusable, single-purpose functions for tasks (e.g., filtering, searching, and saving data).

## Features
* Count Headlines Containing a Word: Count how many headlines contain a specific word.
* Write Matching Headlines to File: Save headlines containing a specific word to a new file.
* Calculate Average Headline Length: Get the average number of characters in the headlines.
* Find Longest and Shortest Headlines: Identify the longest and shortest headlines in the dataset.
* Word Frequency Analysis: Analyze and display the most common words and their frequencies.
* Filter Headlines by Length: Filter headlines based on a specified minimum and maximum length.
* Search for Multiple Words: Search for headlines containing multiple words, using "AND" or "OR" logic.
* Save Analysis Report: Save the analysis results (e.g., word frequency, average length) to a file.
* Plot Word Frequency: Visualize the top 10 most common words in the dataset as a bar chart.
* Load a New File: Switch to analyzing a different dataset without restarting the program.


## Technologies Used
* Python: Core programming language.
* Matplotlib: For data visualization.
* Collections.Counter: For efficient word frequency analysis.

## What This Program Demonstrates
* Proficiency in Python for text processing and analysis.
* Ability to create user-friendly tools with robust error handling.
* Basic data visualization skills.
* Modular, maintainable code design.
